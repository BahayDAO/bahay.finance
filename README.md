Introducing BahayDAO
BahayDAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the BHY token. Each BHY token will be backed by a basket of assets including real assets in the Bahay treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Bahay also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding. 

BahayDAO is a collective of homeowners, housing activists, real estate professionals and entrepreneurs who aim to pool their knowledge and expertise to help make an impact in the real world problem of housing everywhere.

BahayDAO is building an open-source, transparent community that will leverage the power of the DAOâ€™s protocol owned liquidity and real asset portfolio to deliver higher ROI than if you were to invest in properties on your own. 

BahayDAO is an evolving network coordinating the acquisition and management of real assets and investing in projects that help combat the housing crisis.
